# GHG Emissions Calculator	

This simulator calculates scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions according to the "value factor" of $236 per tonne of CO2 equivalents recently proposed by the International Foundation for Valuing Impacts. Users can input reporting data for the three scopes, provide the reporting unit used, and the calculator will compute a monetised total emissions "bill" based on the inputted parameters.
